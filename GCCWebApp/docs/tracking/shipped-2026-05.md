## DEF-109 — Tile period dates off-by-one in negative-UTC timezones (2026-05-01)

Analysts editing a certificate would enter `5/10/2026` and see it correctly on the Edit form and on the cert detail page, but the same cert on the **internal** and **external tile listings** rendered as `5/9/2026` — one calendar day earlier. The public tile listing was already correct.

Root cause was a global JSON converter (`UtcDateTimeConverter`) that we added during the Amazon Partner API work to make every API timestamp end in `"Z"` — matching the format Amazon's developer guide examples use. That converter was correct for true timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`), but it also stamped a `Z` onto calendar-only dates like `EffectiveDate`. Browsers then read `"2026-05-10T00:00:00Z"` as UTC midnight and converted it to local time — which in US Eastern is the previous evening, so the calendar date displayed shifts back a day.

The public tile API had been pre-formatting these two fields as plain `yyyy-MM-dd` strings (no time component, no `Z`), which is why public didn't have the bug. The fix is to apply the same pre-formatting in the internal and external tile APIs. Two files, four lines. **Partner API output is unchanged** — the immutability rule on `/api/v1/certificates*` is preserved.

Verified locally on `http://localhost:5101` with Playwright in the `America/New_York` timezone: API responses now return `yyyy-MM-dd` strings, and rendered tile cards display the same calendar date as the database value.

Files: `Controllers/Api/CertificateTileInternalApiController.cs`, `Controllers/Api/CertificateTileExternalApiController.cs`.
